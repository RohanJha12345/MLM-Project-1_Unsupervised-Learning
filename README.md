# MLM-Project-1_Unsupervised-Learning
# Overview
This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and meaningful groupings in data. The notebook focuses primarily on clustering methods such as K-Means and hierarchical clustering. These methods are used to analyze datasets without any predefined labels, making it a valuable exercise in exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition.

# Key Objectives
To apply unsupervised learning methods to a dataset.
To preprocess data for clustering analysis.
To implement K-Means clustering and evaluate its performance.
To visualize the clusters and interpret the results.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was preprocessed to ensure that it is suitable for clustering analysis. Key preprocessing steps include handling missing values (if any), scaling features, and preparing the data for input into clustering algorithms.

# Tech Stack
# Programming Language: Python
# Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
sklearn: For implementing clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics.
# Project Workflow
# Data Loading and Exploration:

The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and basic exploratory analysis is performed to understand the data distribution, identify missing values, and assess feature correlations.
# Data Preprocessing:

Scaling: Features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity and improve clustering performance.
Feature Selection: Unnecessary or redundant features are removed to simplify the analysis.

# Clustering Algorithms:

# K-Means Clustering:
The algorithm is applied to segment the data into meaningful clusters.
The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Visualization: Clusters are visualized in a 2D space for interpretability using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (if applicable).

# Evaluation:

The performance of clustering is evaluated using metrics like the Silhouette Score.
Results are analyzed to understand cluster characteristics and derive actionable insights.

# Conclusion:

A summary of findings is presented, highlighting the utility of clustering in identifying patterns and insights within the dataset.
 
# Future Scope
Exploring additional clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models.
Applying dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP for better visualization.
Using real-world datasets to validate the methodology and results.
