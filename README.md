## **Overview**  
![Clustering Overview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200)  

This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and meaningful groupings in data. The focus is primarily on clustering methods such as **K-Means** and **hierarchical clustering**. By analyzing datasets without predefined labels, this exercise serves as a valuable tool in **exploratory data analysis** and **pattern recognition**.
